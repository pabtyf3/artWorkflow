# Storybook Painterly Theme

**storybook_painterly** is a soft, illustrative style theme intended for narrative-focused games and scenes.

This theme is designed to:
- support hand-painted workflows
- reduce visual harshness
- encourage warmth and cohesion
- remain flexible for individual artistic interpretation

It does **not** enforce a specific look or colour palette.

## Intended Use

This theme works well for:
- point-and-click adventure games
- walking simulators
- narrative exploration games
- illustrated environments

It is particularly suited to solo developers or small teams who want visual consistency without rigid constraints.

## What This Theme Provides

### Tool Availability
- Soft and textured brushes suitable for painterly strokes
- Limited blending modes to avoid over-processing
- Gentle erasers for non-destructive correction

### Colour Guidance
- Warm, mid-range values

- Low to medium contrast to preserve softness

### Texture Guidance
- Subtle paper or canvas grain
- Textures should enhance, not replace, brushwork

### Workflow Hints
- Clear separation between background, midground, and foreground
- Lighting kept on separate layers for flexibility

## What This Theme Does NOT Do

- It does not choose colours for you
- It does not apply brushes automatically
