This module defines canonical human reference semantics for ergonomics.
It describes semantic measurements only; it does not encode geometry.

Values in this module are intended for archetype generators and other
semantic layers. Blender and other runtime tools must never import from
this folder.

The ergonomics definitions here are deterministic and canonical.
