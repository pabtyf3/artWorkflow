# Frontend Flow

## Role
- Scene intent editor, not an art tool.
- Captures intent and converts it into structured, deterministic scene specifications.

## Notes-First Workflow
- Capture notes.
- Promote notes to a structured scene.
- Select view.
- Select output targets.
- Generate outputs.

## The User Should Never Have To Think About
- File formats, export settings, or render pipelines.
- Tool-specific constraints or workflow quirks.
- Pass management, layer structures, or naming conventions.
- Synchronization between notes and structured scene data.

## The Frontend Must Hide
- Interpreter-specific implementation details.
- Asset instancing mechanics.
- Render pass generation specifics.
- Internal schema wiring and validation steps.
